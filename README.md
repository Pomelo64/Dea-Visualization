# Dea-Visualization
The source code of DEA visualisation applet 


DEA visualization has been a neglected part of DEA softwares. 
Based on the research that I have done during my PhD studies, I decided to write a package for dea visualization
However, the package would be not very useful for many scholars who do not know R
Thus I thought it would be a better idea to make an applet first. 

This repository is the source code of the applet. 

The applet can be found here:  https://ashkiani.shinyapps.io/dea-viz/

Please do not forget to cite the applet if you use it in your research
I would be happy to be informed about the studies that use this applet : contact @  shahin.ashkiani .com
